## Project Bootstraper

Project bootstraper is meant for quickly setting up your Laravel 5 project and generating the basic models, repositories, migrations and so on.

Because this project is still in development, the only way to use the generator is via the config file `generator.xml` in the root of the directory. Once the proper file generation is complete and tested, I intend to provide a simple web interface for creating/uploading the configuration and return a compressed archive of generated files.
